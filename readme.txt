Build modal and fly-out popups using Beaver Builder. Manage popups across the site with a simple and intuitive dashboard.

Requires the Beaver Builder plugin (1.9.5 and above).

== Description ==

Finally, a popup plugin you have total control of.

Capture leads and subscribers with popups that are designed from top to bottom using the tried, tested and loved Beaver Builder page builder, then manage the triggers for your popups from a single manager dashboard.

No more popup clashes, no more dragging placeholder modules on to the page - just one place to manage your popups.

= Drag and drop popup builder =

Built on top of Beaver Builder, Beaver Popups gives you **complete** control over the design and structure of your popups.

Utilise Beaver Builder's modules to create any type of popup you like. A contact form, purchase page or email subscription capture!

Not only that, but you then also have 1 dashboard from where to manage them.
